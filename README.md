# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

This week, we have collaborated on a LEGO Project via the Olympiad in which we got to create something from scratch to fit a specific goal. I didn't however participate much in this
activity because I weren't interested in working with LEGO as such, have missed sessions. Although, I can see a potential benefit in developing team-work skills in a class that was fairly
new, this would help build the initial foundation of a relationship and be on open terms with other colleagues. A lot of guest speakers in this week which some were of use however others were kind of
irrelevant. The fact that we got to see the entire team and kind of get a glimpse of each supporting member of staff.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals


As I have some prior python knowledge, I feel it has helped me get a head start towards developing the initial pygame skills that I will need for game development.
This week was by far the most intimidating at first because of the sheer influx of information that is coming in. I found it very overwhelming and was stressed for most of that Monday. As the days went on,
the pressure eased as I was getting used to my surroundings and it has helped me be content with the chaos that was happening at the time. I felt that the tutors provided a good understanding of computing
fundamentals and I felt acquainted with the basics. I also felt like the introduction to each module was explained well as I knew what the tasks ahead of me were.
