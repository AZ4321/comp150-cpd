# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

This week, we have collaborated on a LEGO Project via the Olympiad in which we got to create something from scratch to fit a specific goal. I didn't however participate much in this
activity because I weren't interested in working with LEGO as such, have missed sessions. Although, I can see a potential benefit in developing team-work skills in a class that was fairly
new, this would help build the initial foundation of a relationship and be on open terms with other colleagues. A lot of guest speakers in this week which some were of use however others were kind of
irrelevant. The fact that we got to see the entire team and kind of get a glimpse of each supporting member of staff.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals


As I have some prior python knowledge, I feel it has helped me get a head start towards developing the initial pygame skills that I will need for game development.
This week was by far the most intimidating at first because of the sheer influx of information that is coming in. I found it very overwhelming and was stressed for most of that Monday. As the days went on,
the pressure eased as I was getting used to my surroundings and it has helped me be content with the chaos that was happening at the time. I felt that the tutors provided a good understanding of computing
fundamentals and I felt acquainted with the basics. I also felt like the introduction to each module was explained well as I knew what the tasks ahead of me were.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

In this week, I have been introduced to tinkering graphics within python. I felt that a lot of it went over my head as each algorithm although explained, translating it into the pygame environment proved to be
difficult for me, this was mostly down to lack of knowledge of pygame itself and I feel that if i studied the documentation a bit closer, i can relate the source code to the right format and be able to make a 
functioning program from scratch. In preperation for the Tinkering Graphics assignment, I could ready myself by studying more python related documents/programs. I have also been introduced to the Agile Philosophy,
so far the concept seems fairly straight-forward as it is constant revision and communication between the developer and the client.

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

During this week, I have began working on the Tinkering Graphics assignment and was mostly working on sprite generation which was the contract that I picked. In this program, I have decided to randomize a set of 5
monster images and have the program randomize which color is shown on the screen. I have encountered some problems as I was struggling getting the exit loop for the program to stay on the screen. In addition, in this week
I have created a concept for the game and it was called SpaceVenture(great name). The idea was that the galaxy was 3D and freeroam but whenever you would want to land on a planet, it would switch to a 2D style platformer game.
GitHub introduction was made also, so far not really understanding its function but it is something that I need to work on as the weeks go on.

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

To begin this week, I have started my first game development project with a completely new team with people whom I have never really met before. We brain-stormed a lot of ideas, everything that was from the 2D RPG field, I gave
a lot of features to be added that were eventually discarded due to scope, at first I didn't really consider the scope and was just thinking of cool mechanics that we could add, not thinking of how complex they would be to perform
in python which was eventually my downfall as when it came to actually programming some of those features, I realized the mistake in my way of thinking. This was also the week where I learned more about academic writing, not knowing
anything about it before. I have learned how to do basic structuring in that particular session.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory


In this week, we have mostly spent learning Latex/Bibtex and how to work in them. At first, the interface was hard to grasp but then as I continued to use it, it made more and more sense. As well as learning LaTex, I have been introduced
to more academic writing techniques to make sure that when the essay need to be in, I am at least somewhat comfortable with the software. This week was mostly dedicated to working on the proposal and the question that I will later adress in the
essay.

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

This was a studio practice week in which I spent most of the time working on the game and made most of the progress but in the same week, a couple of my cohorts have failed to attend which ended up being stressful as most of the workload was on
two/three of us, the people that actually attended.
