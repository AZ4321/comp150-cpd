# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

This week, we have collaborated on a LEGO Project via the Olympiad in which we got to create something from scratch to fit a specific goal. I didn't however participate much in this
activity because I weren't interested in working with LEGO as such, have missed sessions. Although, I can see a potential benefit in developing team-work skills in a class that was fairly
new, this would help build the initial foundation of a relationship and be on open terms with other colleagues. A lot of guest speakers in this week which some were of use however others were kind of
irrelevant. The fact that we got to see the entire team and kind of get a glimpse of each supporting member of staff.

## Week 1

As I have some prior python knowledge, I feel it has helped me get a head start towards developing the initial pygame skills that I will need for game development.
This week was by far the most intimidating at first because of the sheer influx of information that is coming in. I found it very overwhelming and was stressed for most of that Monday. As the days went on,
the pressure eased as I was getting used to my surroundings and it has helped me be content with the chaos that was happening at the time. I felt that the tutors provided a good understanding of computing
fundamentals and I felt acquainted with the basics. I also felt like the introduction to each module was explained well as I knew what the tasks ahead of me were.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

In this week, I have been introduced to tinkering graphics within python. I felt that a lot of it went over my head as each algorithm although explained, translating it into the pygame environment proved to be
difficult for me, this was mostly down to lack of knowledge of pygame itself and I feel that if i studied the documentation a bit closer, i can relate the source code to the right format and be able to make a 
functioning program from scratch. In preperation for the Tinkering Graphics assignment, I could ready myself by studying more python related documents/programs. I have also been introduced to the Agile Philosophy,
so far the concept seems fairly straight-forward as it is constant revision and communication between the developer and the client.

## Week 3

During this week, I have began working on the Tinkering Graphics assignment and was mostly working on sprite generation which was the contract that I picked. In this program, I have decided to randomize a set of 5
monster images and have the program randomize which color is shown on the screen. I have encountered some problems as I was struggling getting the exit loop for the program to stay on the screen. In addition, in this week
I have created a concept for the game and it was called SpaceVenture(great name). The idea was that the galaxy was 3D and freeroam but whenever you would want to land on a planet, it would switch to a 2D style platformer game.
GitHub introduction was made also, so far not really understanding its function but it is something that I need to work on as the weeks go on.

## Week 4

To begin this week, I have started my first game development project with a completely new team with people whom I have never really met before. We brain-stormed a lot of ideas, everything that was from the 2D RPG field, I gave
a lot of features to be added that were eventually discarded due to scope, at first I didn't really consider the scope and was just thinking of cool mechanics that we could add, not thinking of how complex they would be to perform
in python which was eventually my downfall as when it came to actually programming some of those features, I realized the mistake in my way of thinking. This was also the week where I learned more about academic writing, not knowing
anything about it before. I have learned how to do basic structuring in that particular session.

## Week 5

In this week, we have mostly spent learning Latex/Bibtex and how to work in them. At first, the interface was hard to grasp but then as I continued to use it, it made more and more sense. As well as learning LaTex, I have been introduced
to more academic writing techniques to make sure that when the essay need to be in, I am at least somewhat comfortable with the software. This week was mostly dedicated to working on the proposal and the question that I will later adress in the
essay.

## Week 6

This was a studio practice week in which I spent most of the time working on the first programmer team based game and made most of the progress but in the same week, a couple of my cohorts have failed to attend which ended up being stressful as most of the workload was on two/three of us, the people that actually attended. But nevertheless, at this point, the game wasn't set in stone as the team was constantly changing how the world generation was going to be, switching back and forth between hex tile generation or just using normal squares to achieve the same thing.

## Week 7

In this week, I had a presentation due about my research towards the Agile Philosophy and what I have managed to learn about it. This presentation had to be in LaTeX format as some referencing was used and this was my first real attempt at using some of the knowledge learned previously about LaTeX. Having not done presentations in a long while, I pressed the fast-forward button on the actual context of the presentation and the things that I was trying to explain. This is something that I need to improve on as the weeks go on as this isn't the only presentation that needs to be done. At this point, not much actual progress is being made on the game due to non-attendees and general disrupted work-flow of 2 people or 3 at max.

## Week 8

As I had been working on my presentation, I'd realized that the first deadline for the essay was infact this week so I had been working on the essay straight after the presentation portion was done. And this week, the essay draft was meant to be reviewed by my peers as well as giving feedback to my fellow colleagues on their essays by following the criteria. Reading different papers is definetly an advantage as you get to pick up on some of your own mistakes and have at least 1 thing that needs to be changed by the end of the review session. This has been useful towards producing a high quality paper as a lot of your common habits/mistakes are discovered in this way.

## Week 9

This week, a lot more progress was made on the game as I had just finished the main title screen and the instruction screen to give the player something to look at as there was a lack of a real game behind the images. As the main investor pitch deadline was coming up, a lot of the same team members have started to attend and do actual work however, it was too late and everything may as well had been on fire at that point. The status of the game at this point was the two images that were in the build and a character image on the screen that couldn't be moved. At this point, the team has completely given up on the game and so have I. Simultaneously working on the Research Journal that is meant to be due in soon.

## Week 10

This week was spent preparing for the investor pitches by preparing a presentation whilst communicating through discord to which, 4 people showed up for. Surprisingly, discord was the only way we could get in-touch with the other half of the group which I found amusing. Everyone had shown up at the investor pitch yet there was still a sense of panic as there was no real game to be shown and we knew that. I tried to cover as much as I could with the slide that I had done on the features that were still to be implemented if extra funds were added, however as I was doing the presentation, I had not realized that another peer has done the same so, we ended up repeating ourselves which caused a dissarray when the presentation was done as the investors were confused. Overall, a massive loss with significant personal gain.

## Week 11

The game was over, the investor pitch was done and the essay was handed in as I feel a sense of relief after weeks of deadlines in a row, yet I remain standing, barely. Throughout the previos project, a lot of GitHub was used and as such, this week I had focused on learning how to branch within GitHub to allow work on different branches to be done simultaneously whilst not breaking the main build. This would be useful as to have a working build constantly for the upcoming project.

## Week 13

The previous game was over and so the next collaborative game project begins, this time with other designers, animation people and etc. So the idea that was decided within this week was that the game should be top-down, have a shooting mechanic and be an RPG. Following by a lot of examples from the bullet-hell genre of games such as Furi or Enter the Gungeon. This was the direction that the game was took in the end, the RPG elements ended up not making it in the real-game and it turned out to be not much different from your average bullet-hell game as the distinct aspect that we had, it being the "six-shot" mechanic which has types of bullets also ended up not making it into the game.

## Week 14

This week, we present BlastBack as a game along with its gameplay trailer to show what we've been working on all these weeks prior. Having seen the projects other teams were working on, I wasn't nervous going into it because I knew the work that I did towards it and as such, the nerves were at ease. This game project had been the more interesting one because there was actually something there to work towards instead of not even having a skeleton of a game in-place. It felt motivating to achieve certain features within BlastBack and although some issues were present within the team, I still enjoyed working on the game.
